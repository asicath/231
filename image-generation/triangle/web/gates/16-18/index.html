<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Tower + The Moon</h1>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Mars + Pisces</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">SATIETY</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top: 0;">TEN OF CUPS</h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>This card represents a conflicting element. On the one hand, it receives the influence of the Ten, Malkah the Virgin. The arrangement of the cups is that of the Tree of Life. But, on the other hand, they are themselves unstable. They are tilted; they spill the water from the great Lotus which overhangs the whole system from one into the other.</p>
<p>The work proper to water is complete: and disturbance is due.</p>
<p>This comes from the influence of Mars in Pisces. Mars is the gross, violent and disruptive force which inevitably attacks every supposed perfection. His energy displays the greatest possible contrast with that of Pisces, which is both peaceful and spiritualized.</p>
