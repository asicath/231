<h3>THREE OF WANDS</h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>This card refers to Binah in the suit of Fire, and so represents the establishment of primeval Energy. The Will has been transmitted to the Mother, who conceives, prepares, and gives birth to, its manifestation.</p>
<p>It refers to the Sun in Aries, the Sign in which he is exalted.</p>
<p>The meaning is harmonious, for this is the beginning of Spring. For this reason one sees the wand taking the form of the Lotus in blossom. The Sun has enkindled the Great Mother.</p>
<p>In the Yi King, Sol in Aries is represented by the 11th hexagram, Thai; its meaning is identical with the above description.</p>
