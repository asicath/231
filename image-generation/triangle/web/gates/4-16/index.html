<p>This card, pertaining to Chokmah in the suit of Fire, represents the Will in its most exalted form. It is an ideal Will, independent of any given object.</p>
<p>"For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect." AL. 1. 44.</p>
<p>The background of this card shows the power of the planet Mars in his own sign Aries, the first of the Signs. It there represents Energy initiating a Current of Force.</p>
<p>The pictorial representation is two Dorjes crossed. The Dorje is the Tibetan symbol of the thunderbolt, the emblem of celestial Power, but more in its destructive than its creative form.</p>
<p>More, that is, in its earlier rather than its later form. For destruction may be regarded as the first step in the creative process. The virgin ovum must be broken in order to fertilize it. Fear and repulsion are therefore the primary reaction to the assault. Then, with understanding of the complete plan, willing surrender rejoices to co-operate.</p>
<p>Six flames issue from the centre. This indicates the influence of the Sun, who is exalted in Aries. This is the creative Will.</p>
<p>Mars in Aries is the attribution of the Geomantic Figure Puer. [Puer Image 1-1-22-1] The meaning of these figures is to be studied in the Handbook of that science: "The Equinox" Vol. I, No.2. Remember that the Geomantic Intelligences (see Liber 777 Cols. XLIX and CLXXVIII) are all primarily Gnomes.</p>
